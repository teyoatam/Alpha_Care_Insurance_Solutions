Task 1:
Git and GitHub Project Planning - EDA & Stats

Task 2:
Data Version Control (DVC)

EDA is crucial for understanding the data, identifying patterns, and gaining insights. Here are the steps you should follow:
Data Summarization:

Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical features like TotalPremium and TotalClaims.
Review the data types (dtype) of each column to ensure proper formatting (e.g., categorical variables, dates).
Data Quality Assessment:

Check for missing values in any of the columns.
Handle missing values appropriately (impute or drop, depending on the context).
Univariate Analysis:

Plot histograms for numerical columns (e.g., TotalPremium, TotalClaims) to understand their distributions.
Create bar charts for categorical columns (e.g., CoverType, MaritalStatus) to visualize their frequencies.
Bivariate or Multivariate Analysis:

Explore correlations and associations between variables.
Specifically, investigate how monthly changes in TotalPremium relate to TotalClaims based on geographical factors (e.g., ZipCode). Scatter plots and correlation matrices can be useful here.
Data Comparison:

Analyze trends over geography. Compare changes in insurance cover type, premium, and auto make across different regions.
Outlier Detection:

Use box plots to identify outliers in numerical data (e.g., unusually high or low TotalPremium values).
Visualization:

Create three visually appealing plots that capture key insights from your EDA. These could include trend lines, geographical heatmaps, or other relevant visualizations.
